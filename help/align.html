<html><h2>Image alignment</h2>

Ticking <u>Align images?</u> will correct small xy drift due to acquisition by computing the translation coordinates for donor stack of images and applying it to both.<br>
It is advised to check the result at the end of the clean step as it might fail for low contrast images or create a small drift for long stacks.
