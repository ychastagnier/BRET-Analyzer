<html><h2>Threshold methods</h2>
Values that are under the calculated threshold are set to 0 to ignore them during further process.<br>

<h4>Auto Threshold</h4>
The threshold value is calculated once for the whole image.<br>

<h4>Auto Local Threshold</h4>
The threshold is calculated for each pixel, using the neighboring pixels (in AutoLocalTh radius).<br>

<h4>Median and Mean * Coefficient</h4>
The threshold is calculated using the median or mean * coefficient of the area selected by the user and applied on whole image.<br>


<h2>Other parameters</h2>
Coefficient is used only with method Mean * Coefficient. The threshold is set to the coefficient value multiplied by the mean intensity value of the area selected.<br>
AutoLocalTh radius is used only with local threshold methods and determines the area used to calculate the threshold of each pixel.<br>
Minimum threshold sets the value under which the pixel intensity is set to zero anyway after application of the threshold method selected, if set to a value higher than zero.<br>
